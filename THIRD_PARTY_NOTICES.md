# Third-party notices

The Richman 4 (大富翁4) engine in this repository is GPL-3.0-or-later (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). Game
content is **not** included and is not covered by any license here; see [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md).

No third-party source code, binaries, fonts or sound banks are committed to this repository. The build
scripts download the components below into gitignored directories (`android/third_party/`,
`ios/third_party/`) and verify each download by SHA-256, or the Mac build links the Homebrew copies.

FluidSynth and GNU libiconv are LGPL-licensed. The combined program is distributed under the GPL-3.0,

## Bundled data (phone builds)

| Component | Use | License |

| [GeneralUser GS](https://github.com/mrbumpy409/GeneralUser-GS) by S. Christian Collins | General MIDI sound bank for the original MIDI music on Android/iOS (the Mac build uses the system's `gs_instruments.dls` and bundles nothing). | GeneralUser GS License (see its repository). The author notes that the provenance of every sample cannot be fully guaranteed. |
| [Noto Serif CJK TC](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk) | Traditional Chinese text on Android/iOS, and the fallback when the original 細明體 is unavailable. | SIL Open Font License 1.1 |

The Mac build can use 細明體 (`mingliu.ttc`) from a locally installed Microsoft Office; that font is
proprietary, is never copied into this repository or any build, and is used only from its installed
location.

## Reference and test infrastructure (not part of the game)

| [Boxedwine](https://github.com/danoon2/Boxedwine) 26R1.0 + Wine 11.0 | Runs the user's own original executable on macOS to capture comparison data (oracle tests) and as a reference player. | Boxedwine: GPL-2.0; Wine: LGPL-2.1-or-later |
| mingw-w64, NASM | Rebuild the upstream disassembly for reference (`scripts/build_upstream.sh`). | various open-source licenses |

The oracle tests invoke the user's local original executable; neither that binary nor its machine code
is embedded in this repository. Oracle outputs and screenshots stay in gitignored local directories.
